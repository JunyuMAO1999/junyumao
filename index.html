<center><h2>Here's my story~</h2></center>



<p>I'm Junyu Mao, a first year master's student from Beijing Foreign Studies University, P.R.China.</p>

<p>Nice to meet you!</p>


<h2>The Very Beginning</h2>

<p>My connection with coding started from primary school. At that time, I signed up for the coding course as an extracurricular activity, but dropped out of it a few weeks later. And that's because I felt hopeless to cope with the complicated programs. </p>

<h2>And then</h2>

<p>When I was a junior high school student, I signed up for two extracurricular activities related to computuer -- coding course (Pascal) and multimedia design course (PS, FrontPage, etc.). However, after a sudden fever, I was persuaded to relieve "pressure" and withdraw from some activities for the sake of the health. Therefore, I dropped out of the coding course and stayed in the other, though I had just received praise and obtained recognition from my teacher during the first lessons.</p>

<h2>After that</h2>

<p>The year when I started my senior high school life witnessed the reform of CEE (College Entrance Examination) in Zhejiang Province, my hometown. Thanks to this reform, I could substitute Physics with Technology (both GT and IT) as my test subject, and my life got connected with coding (VB, Visual Basic) again. I felt quite enthusiastic about designing the programs and applying them in real life. For example, I could still remember how excited I was when I designed a Timer program and used it to keep time for 1-min speech during a class meeting.</p>



<h2>Undergraduate stage</h2>

<p>My passion for the coding keeps burning even after the change of my "identity" -- from "student of science" in high school to "student of arts" in university. If time and energy permitted, I still wanted to write some programs to facilitate daily life. For instane, I designed a VB-based APP in Grade 4, where the users can do exercises of Arabic Numeral Phrases. I shared this APP with my classmates, since I was then commissary in charge of studies in my class, and I had the responsibility to help others practice this complicated numeral-noun construction with ease. (You can see user interface of this APP via <a href="https://junyumao1999.github.io/User-interface-of-a-simple-APP/">this link</a>.)</p>


<h2>Looking forward to the future</h2>

<p>How time flies! In the blink of an eye, I started my MA life. Though enchanted with all the progress and development happening to this fast-changing digital world, I couldn't help but feel unsettled and anxious. It seems that every day begins with a question: what if I can't keep pace with the times and lag behind? Maybe the answer to this question is "to reignite my passion for the coding and continue the previous story". Thus, I created my GitHub page and made full preparations. The best is yet to come.</p>
<p>I look forward to the bright future and hold the firm belief that the best is yet to come!</p>
